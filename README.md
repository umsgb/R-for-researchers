# R-for-researchers
This is the monthly R user group meeting for R users at the Bannatyne Campus in University of Manitoba, jointly organized by the Statistical Genomics and Bioinformatics (SGB) Platform, CHRIM Bioinformatics Core, and the Data Science Platform at the Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI).
